# Deece


Deece is a, open, collaborative, and decentralised search mechanism for IPFS. Any node running the client is able to crawl content on IPFS and add this to the index, which itself is stored in a decentralised manner on IPFS. This allows for decentralised search on decentralised content.  

(*The current implementation is still highly experimental. It only supports search and crawl on PDF's on IPFS, and requires delegation of trust to the gateway for updating the TLI entry*).

## Overview





### Motivation

Currenly, Web users have few alternatives to *centralised* search engines. These engines maintain centralised control, policy and trust, which may lead to issues in censorship, privacy protection, and transparency. 

Furthermore, these engines generally focus their efforts on traditional Web content (hosted at Web servers, accessed through the DNS). However, in a Web3 paradigm, where content is expected to be stored at decentralised storage networks (s.a. IPFS) and name resolution to take place through blockchain solutions (s.a. ENS), an alternative search engine is required. 

In short, a search mechanism is needed which searches decentralised data, and does so in a decentralised manner.
